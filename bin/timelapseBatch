# Creates a timelapse video from every file in the current directory for every "whichFrameNumberToTake".
# Usage:
#   $0 whichFrameNumberToTake1 whichFrameNumberToTake2 whichFrameNumberToTake3...
#
# Eg If whichFrameNumberToTake is 4, then every 4th frame will contribute to the final video. This is effectively how many times to speed up the footage.
#
# Eg For every file in the current directory, this will create slow-mos of speed 2, 10, and 100.
#   $0 2 10 100
