# Creates a timelapse video from every file in the current directory. Each subsequent file gets a faster timelapse than the previous file.
# Usage:
#   $0 startingFrameNumberToTake howMuchToIncrement
#
# If startingFrameNumberToTake is 4, then every 4th frame will contribute to the final video. This is effectively how many times to speed up the footage.
# If howMuchToIncrement is 2, and the startingFrameNumberToTake is 4, then the first file will be timelapsed at 4, The second at 6, The third at 8, etc
#
# Eg This will create a sequence starting at 10, and incrementing by 3 for each new file.
#   $0 10 3
