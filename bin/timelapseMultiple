# Calls timelapse for each whichFrameNumberToTake.
# Usage:
#   $0 fileName whichFrameNumberToTake1 whichFrameNumberToTake2 whichFrameNumberToTake3...
#
# Eg If whichFrameNumberToTake is 4, then every 4th frame will contribute to the final video. This is effectively how many times to speed up the footage.
#
# Eg For vokoscreenNG-2023-07-26_20-37-47.mkv, create slow-mos of speed 2, 10, and 100.
#   $0 vokoscreenNG-2023-07-26_20-37-47.mkv 2 10 100
